      Step by step I will explain the basics of improvisation for any instrument, any level of musical skill and with no basic knowledge required. Everyone can learn and develop the skill of improvisation as long as you are interested and motivated to learn!

      This is how it works: In every lesson you’ll find several steps each time explained in a video, an overview with a challenge and a goal, and a tab with playalong tracks. Watch the video, read the goals, start the playalong and start playing! The learning platform as a whole is a very dynamic workspace. Even though parts of the course are presented linear, feel free to explore them dynamically by switching between lessons and repeating previous lessons.

      Since improvisation is a very personal experience and cannot be checked by algorithms whether you’re right or wrong, I advise you to find feedback from a professional. In the end, nothing goes above a good teacher!

      If you’re student, I hope you’ll find my course useful to explore the art of improvisation and find joy in exploring the possibilities of your instrument more freely. For teachers out there, I hope you find my course useful to use in your classroom as learning material for your students. It is here for you to use!
