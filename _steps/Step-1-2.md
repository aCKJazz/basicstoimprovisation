title: "Step 2 - Finding the right notes"
video: LCzSmWqQwIs
overview: "The next step in getting comfortable with your instrument and improvisation is to find the right notes to play. Instead of working it out by theory, we will do an exercise to find them ourselves. After watching the instructions, use the playalong to try to find the right notes for yourself."
transcription: "Hey, welcome back to step 2 in your first lesson. In the previous step, we really explored the instrument and all the possibilities without limitations. In this second step we are going to create a first limitation and we are going to do that by using the playalong that you can find in the link bellow. So be sure to download it before you start the exercise.
If you listen to the playalong you will hear that it is one big stretched sound. What we are going to do is going to explore our instrument again and we're also going to try to find all the possibilities. But while doing that you will very soon notice that all notes that you can play are good notes to play. They won't all sound very good. Some will sound better than others and some will even sound really bad, that you don't want to play them at all. So, what I want you to do in this lesson is play that playalong, let that sounds come to you, try any note on your instrument, and try to memorize what notes work and what notes don't. If you know the note names then that's great, maybe write them down. If you don't know the note names, then maybe just remember the position on the instrument or the grip that you have.
Try to be attentive and listen very carefully. I give you a quick example. Now, try it yourself!"
