title: "Step 3 - Comparing Improvisation With Other Musical Disciplines"
video: yuOWzcSpODc
overview: "We can learn to understand improvisation better by comparing it to other musical disciplines.
There is a spectrum of musical practices and improvisation is part of it. This video will explain that spectrum and how it will help us become better improvisers."
transcription: "Let’s look at improvisation a bit more closely by comparing it with two other musical disciplines : experimentation and composition. A composer writes down music for us to play, he or she searches beautiful melodies and arranges them for us. When we play the composition we already know in advance how it will sound like when we’ve managed to read it and play it. The end result is known. Experimental music is another discipline in music. When experimenting we create a setup, a framework, within which we will operate, but we will not determine the exact outcome. The exact end result is unknown. So how is this with improvisation? Well, I would argue it is in the space between these two. The exact end result is unknown, but it isn’t completely unknown either. There is some knowledge of where one is and where he or she might go. Compare it to telling a story. We can read from a book; that is like a composition. We can also shout out random words, like experimentation. But when you spontaneously make up a story that has to make sense, you kind of know what you want to say, but you haven’t defined every word and every sentence up front. Every time you tell your story it might come out slightly different. So what do we learn from this? Learning how to improvise is about finding that space between composition and experimentation. Throughout the course we will explore both these sides, as they will help us to improve our improvisation skills, that grey zone within."
