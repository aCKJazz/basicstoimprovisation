title: Step 3 - Comparing Improvisation With Other Musical Disciplines
video: e-opg3fTl3k
overview: There is a spectrum within which improvisation is a part. In a musical context we can place it as part of a continuum in between composition and experimentation. How we should understand this and what we learn from this is explained in the video.
transcription: Let's look at improvisation a bit more closely by comparing it with two other musical disciplines - experimentation and composition. A composer writes down music for us to play, he or she searches beautiful melodies and arranges them for us. When we play the composition we already know in advance how it will sound like when we’ve managed to read it and play it. The end result is known. Experimental music is another discipline in music. When experimenting we create a setup, a framework, within which we will operate, but we will not determine the exact outcome. The exact end result is unknown. So how is this with improvisation? Well, I would argue it is in the space between these two. The exact end result is unknown, but it isn’t completely unknown either. There is some knowledge of where one is and where he or she might go. Compare it to telling a story. You kind of know what you want to say, but you haven’t defined every word and every sentence up front. Every time you tell your story it might come out slightly different. This is very different from a composition, where every detail is planned; while as we’ve saw before, improvising is spontaneous, just like experimenting. So what do we learn from this? Learning how to improvise is about finding that space between composition and experimentation. Throughout the course we will explore both these sides, as they will help us to improve our improvisation skills.
