overview: "When we explore freely, we don't want to restart from scratch every day again. We have to try to memorize what we do. In this exercise I will show you what you can do to train your memory. Good ideas are worth keeping, right? Let's repeat the songs from step 2 and 3, but this time we will try to memorize short ideas and repeat them."
