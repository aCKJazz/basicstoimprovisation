video: Sc80YylI6sM
overview: "In this fifth part I will explain to you how you can evaluate your progress or receive assessment. There are a few steps you can take to make sure you are learning. In the media folder you can find visuals that can help you."
transcription: "In the previous video we established that “everything goes”. So how do we know whether we are right or wrong? What is a good or a bad improvisation? How do we make that assessment and how do we evaluate our progress? How can we learn if there is not one correct answer? Let me start by saying that improvisation is a very personal thing, just like music is in general. There are many styles in music and they all have their characteristics that are liked or disliked by others. We call this musical taste and our opinions can differ a lot here. However, we do can look at certain musical parameters like rhythm, melody, harmony, timbre, but also the expressed emotions to assess whether these parameters are well developed when we improvise. At this point there is no fancy algorithm or AI that can keep track of you while you play, and I don’t think it a good idea that exists. If you want to make sure you are learning something, take the following steps to make sure you are evolving. First, assess yourself. Record yourself, play back your recording and evaluate what you did. Don’t be too harsh on yourself. A good evaluation looks first at the strengths. What did you like? Try to name it. Then, name one thing you didn’t like. How can you do better? What is it you’re missing? Take this one thing you want to improve, start again, and just work on that one thing. Second step, ask a friend. Play for a friend who also likes and plays music and ask what they think. If your friend is also learning to improvise you can share ideas and learn from each other. Step three, upload your recording on the platform and ask for peer-assessment. You can also listen to what others upload to get some ideas. Give them some feedback and maybe ask what they do to learn from them. Fourth step should not be forgotten. Find a professional. Nothing goes above a good teacher. Ask for a private lesson and show that teacher what you’ve learned. Ask them for feedback and make a list of things you can improve. In the end, it is practice that makes perfect. Recycle the steps to keep your growth process going. Click on media under this video to find supportive material."
