title: "Step 4 - Knowledge For Improvisation"
video: 1lSgTFIuVgU
overview: "So what is important knowledge for becoming a good improviser?
In this part I’ll share some insights with you, put things into perspective and set out an overview of the necessary knowledge for improvisation. In the end, not much knowledge is needed to start improvising, but the more you know, the better an improviser you’ll become."
transcription: "So what knowledge do we need to become good improvisors? To experiment we need little to no knowledge at all. It is very instinctive and it doesn’t really matter where we end up. To play a composition we need knowledge of reading music and how to interpret it on our instrument. Theoretical knowledge and knowing the right techniques can support us to bring a good performance. The knowledge needed for improvisation is more abstract, and that’s where it gets tricky for a lot of people. Instead of learning exact notes, we have to look at the structures and frameworks within which we operate. In addition we can learn to memorize patterns that we know work well in that framework. Look at it as playing a family game. If you want to play chess, you need to know the rules of chess and then many options are available. Good chess players have memorized many patterns and tactical moves that can lead to a successful game. Change the game and you’re in a whole different framework with new strategies attached. These frameworks in music can be chord structures, a time feel or musical styles like Jazz, Hip-Hop or Latin. And before you panic, these structures can be as easy or complicated as you want yourself. Of course, when we start, we keep things simple. The basics of improvisation are practiced in slow tempos, with easy rhythms and on just one or several chords. Learning the frameworks is learning about the possibilities and limitations of these frameworks. Music theory helps us understand what will sound good and what won’t before we even touched our instrument. But before we get there, let me reveal you a little secret. Eventually it all comes down to this- “if it sounds good, it works”. Or as the famous philosopher Paul Feyerabend once said “Anything Goes”. Even if you don’t know anything about music theory, still, you can learn to improvise just by using your ears and good judgement. You’ll make more mistakes at the start, but as you keep practicing, you’ll automatically discover patterns that work and sound good. In the end, what came first? Music, or music theory? So release yourself from any anxiety and start playing. The music theory will catch up, but let’s have fun first!"
