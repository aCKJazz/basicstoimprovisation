title: "Step 2 - What is improvisation?"
video: SFxa0-6hRVg
overview: "So what exactly is improvisation? In this video I'll explain why you are already an improviser, without realising it. The goal of this video is to make you realise improvisation isn't that excentric as it might seem. We can all learn how to do it."
transcription: "So what is improvisation exactly?
 Improvising means creating or performing something spontaneously. It occurs in many forms and disciplines like in theatre, comedy, dance, and music of course, but also in science or engineering. In fact, it happens more often than you might think. Did you know you already improvise on a daily basis without realising it? Did you have a conversation with someone today? Did you know what you were going to say before you started the conversation, or did it just come in the moment? Like, spontaneously. I’m sure you’ve already had a meal today. Did you follow strict instructions telling you what to do to get that food from the cupboard into your mouth? No, of course not. You rely on habits. But are those habits exactly the same every day? Maybe for some they are, but for most of us they can be slightly different every day again. Improvisation is actually quite the same. So we already improvise on a daily basis. But those habits we have in daily life don’t automatically transfer to new experiences, like making music. Even Vijay Iyer, a master in improvisation on piano, said he still cannot improvise on violin, the instrument he practiced first. So the ability to improvise has to be learned,… By practicing improvisation."
