"Terence: But don’t I need to know about music theory first?

Adriaan: Don’t worry about that! The first lessons don’t require any previous knowledge. All that you need to know is explained. And while you practice improvisation, new theory is added, so you learn that too while you practice.

Terence: This is really cool! I see they are using the piano a lot, is it only for piano players?

Adriaan: The exercises are explained for all instruments, so it doesn’t matter what instrument you play, you can always do the exercises. I even practice them on the bass!

Terence: Oh yes, I see it now. They say here it is for all ages, all instruments, and no previous knowledge required. I even read here that it is for all cultural backgrounds. What does that mean?

Adriaan: Well, I saw they provide exercises in many different styles of music. So if you like a certain style of music better, you do the exercises in your preferred style, but you can also discover others and learn with them! I like to vary a lot, it really keeps learning interesting!"
