In this lesson I will explain to you what improvisation exactly is, I’ll compare it to other aspects of musical performance, I’ll tell what you need to know before you can start to improvise, for whom it is and when you can use it. Feel free to watch the movies in any order you want, as long as it makes sense to you. These video’s and the explanation are in support of the actual lessons. You might find it useful to sometimes come back to this lesson to further explore the theory and how it relates to practice. It is all very dynamic.
